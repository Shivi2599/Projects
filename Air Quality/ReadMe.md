## Project Background

Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the air—both outdoors and indoors—that pose risks to human health, other living beings, and the environment. These pollutants can include gases such as ozone (O₃) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), as well as fine particulate matter like PM2.5, soot, and dust.

In a city as diverse and densely populated as New York, exposure to these pollutants varies widely across neighbourhoods. Factors such as traffic density, building emissions, infrastructure, and socio-economic conditions significantly influence the air quality experienced by different communities.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Air Quality Trends:** How have pollutant levels (PM2.5, NO₂, O₃) changed over time and by season?
- **Geographic Disparities:** Which neighbourhoods experience the worst air quality and health outcomes?
- **Health Outcomes:** Are emergency visits, hospitalisations, and deaths increasing or decreasing?
-	**Cause Attribution:** Which pollutants are most associated with asthma, cardiovascular, or respiratory conditions?

An interactive dashboard can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Shivi2599/Projects/blob/main/Air%20Quality/Air%20Quality%20Index.pbix).

The SQL queries to clean, prepare, and organise data are [here](https://github.com/Shivi2599/Projects/blob/main/Air%20Quality/Air%20Quality%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)

## Data Structure

The Air Quality database structure, as shown, consists of one table with a total row count of 188,622 records.

Before the analysis, various checks were conducted for quality control and to familiarise myself with the dataset.
