## Project Background

Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the air—both outdoors and indoors—that pose risks to human health, other living beings, and the environment. These pollutants can include gases such as ozone (O₃) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), as well as fine particulate matter like PM2.5, soot, and dust.

In a city as diverse and densely populated as New York, exposure to these pollutants varies widely across neighbourhoods. Factors such as traffic density, building emissions, infrastructure, and socio-economic conditions significantly influence the air quality experienced by different communities.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Air Quality Trends:** How have pollutant levels (PM2.5, NO₂, O₃) changed over time and by season?
- **Geographic Disparities:** Which neighbourhoods experience the worst air quality and health outcomes?
- **Health Outcomes:** Are emergency visits, hospitalisations, and deaths increasing or decreasing?
-	**Cause Attribution:** Which pollutants are most associated with asthma, cardiovascular, or respiratory conditions?

An interactive dashboard can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Shivi2599/Projects/blob/main/Air%20Quality/Air%20Quality%20Index.pbix).

The SQL queries to clean, prepare, and organise data are [here](https://github.com/Shivi2599/Projects/blob/main/Air%20Quality/Air%20Quality%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)

## Data Structure

The Air Quality database structure, as shown, consists of one table with a total row count of 188,622 records.

Before the analysis, various checks were conducted for quality control and to familiarise myself with the dataset. 

## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Over the past 15 years, New York City has seen a gradual improvement in air quality, with levels of PM2.5 and NO₂ steadily declining. In 2008, the average PM2.5 concentration hovered around 11 µg/m³; today, it stands closer to 7.92 µg/m³, marking a 35.44% drop. Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), another harmful pollutant, has also seen a consistent decrease, thanks in part to environmental regulations and cleaner energy initiatives.

Below is the overview page from the Power BI dashboard. More examples are included throughout the report.

But while the skies may be clearer, the health data tells a more complicated story.

Emergency room visits, hospitalisations, and deaths attributed to air pollution remain alarmingly high in several neighbourhoods. These communities face disproportionate exposure to harmful pollutants, particularly during summer months when ozone levels spike sharply.

This analysis highlights not only how far we've come, but also how much work remains. Cleaner air must reach every ZIP code, not just the average.
